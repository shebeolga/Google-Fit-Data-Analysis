# Google Fit Data Analysis
This project uses basic concepts of data analysis: cleaning, exploration, and visualization to describe simple data from Google Fit Application.

Working with data allows us to learn more about the phenomena that surround us, draw scientific conclusions that shed light on what was previously considered unknowable, and help to make informed decisions in all areas of application. That's why I like data and data analysis. I hope to continue my studies and if I find something interesting, I'll share it with people.
